# Command Pattern

- The **command design pattern** encapsulates
  - **method invocation, operations, or requests into a single object**
  - so that we can pass method calls at our discretion.
- The command design pattern
  - gives us an opportunity **to issue commands from anything**
  - executing commands and delegates responsibility to different objects instead.
