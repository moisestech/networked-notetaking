# Factory

- It is a creational concerned with the creation of objects without the need for a constructor.
- It provides a generic interface for creating objects, where we can specify the type of factory objects to be created.
- Therefore, we only specify the object and the factory instantiates and returns it for us to use.
- It is wise for us to use factory pattern when the object component set up has a high level of complexity and when we want to create different instances of objects easily depending on the environment we are in.
- We can also use factory pattern when working with many small objects sharing the same properties and when composing objects that need decoupling.
