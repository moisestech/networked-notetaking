# Factory Pattern

- It is a creational concerned with the creation of objects without the need for a constructor. It provides a generic interface for creating objects, where we can specify the type of factory objects to be created. Therefore, we only specify the object and the factory instantiates and returns it for us to use. It is wise for us to use factory pattern when the object component set up has a high level of complexity and when we want to create different instances of objects easily depending on the environment we are in. We can also use factory pattern when working with many small objects sharing the same properties and when composing objects that need decoupling.
