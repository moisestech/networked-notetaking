# Cypress

- Fast, easy and reliable testing for anything that runs in a browser.

### [Website](https://www.cypress.io/)

- Cypress is popular among testers and developers because it requires no setup. The framework runs on the browser, where it provides an interactive interface. Not only that, you can use Cypress on Mac, Linux, and Windows. Also, the test runner of Cypress allows automated screenshot and video capturing.

- Generally, React developers prefer Cypress. But Cypress also supports other JS frameworks, including Angular and Node. Often, testers compare Cypress with Selenium. But the key difference between the two is that Cypress doesnâ€™t need to integrate with your code.
