- The dream of every JavaScript developer is to create a bug-free web app. You can start your journey on the path of a bug-free code by unit testing your components. But how does Storybook help in that? Well, Storybook makes unit testing easier by helping you to create independent components. Once you’ve done so, you can showcase the components in a dev environment that’s isolated. Not only is Storybook great for unit testing, but it also helps you document test cases and guidelines. Those documents will help other developers who will work on the same project.
