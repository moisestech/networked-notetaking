# Jest

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is a JavaScript test runner that lets you access the DOM via [jsdom](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-environments.html#mocking-a-rendering-surface).
- While jsdom is only an approximation of how the browser works, it is often good enough for testing React components.
- Jest provides a great iteration speed combined with powerful features like mocking modules and timers so you can have more control over how the code executes.

- Jest has plugin for testing react
