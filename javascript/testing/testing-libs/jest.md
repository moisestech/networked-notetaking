# Jest

- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is a JavaScript test runner that lets you access the DOM via [jsdom](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-environments.html#mocking-a-rendering-surface).
- While jsdom is only an approximation of how the browser works, it is often good enough for testing React components.
- Jest provides a great iteration speed combined with powerful features like mocking modules and timers so you can have more control over how the code executes.

- Jest has plugin for testing react

[Jest](https://www.testim.io/blog/jest-testing-a-helpful-introductory-tutorial/) was the most popular JavaScript unit testing framework in 2019. For web apps that are based on React, Jest is the preferred framework. Apart from React, Jest supports unit testing of Angular, VueJS, NodeJS, and others.

Why is Jest popular?

It requires zero setup.  
Managing large test cases is relatively easy because of a snapshot capturing feature.
