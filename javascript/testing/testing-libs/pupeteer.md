# Pupeteer

Developed by Google, Puppeteer provides a cool way to unit test your JavaScript components. For Node JS apps, Puppeteer provides a headless application programming interface that you can use in Chrome. Testim also released a free recorder for Puppeteer.

Here are a few reasons this framework is popular:

Puppeteer supports async, await, and other ES6 features.
It supports automated testing for keyboard input, form submit, and many more features.
Since the tests are browser specific, the tool can also set custom size and resolution of the browser. This helps in responsive testing as well.
