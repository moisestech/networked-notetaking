# React Testing Library

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react) is a set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details.
- This approach makes refactoring a breeze and also nudges you towards best practices for accessibility.
- Although it doesn’t provide a way to “shallowly” render a component without its children, a test runner like Jest lets you do this by mocking.
