# Context API

### [Context API Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

Context provides a way to pass data\
through the component tree\
without having to pass props down\
manually at every level.

- Declare the data that we want available throughout our component tree.
- Typically, you create a new COntext for each unique piece od data that needs to be available throughout the component tree.
