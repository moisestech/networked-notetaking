# applyMiddleware

```js javascript
applyMiddleware(): StoreEnhancer<{}, {}>
```

- Creates a store enhancer that applies middleware to the dispatch method of the Redux store. This is handy for a variety of tasks, such as expressing asynchronous actions in a concise manner, or logging every action payload.

- See [[redux-thunk]] package as an example of the Redux middleware.

- Because middleware is potentially asynchronous, this should be the first store enhancer in the composition chain.

- Note that each middleware will be given the dispatch and getState functions as named arguments.

- @returns â€” A store enhancer applying the middleware.
