- actionCreators

### Folder Structure

Async Data in Redux gets opinionated
So does folder structure
Show you the “rails” pattern its the simples

[Ducks - Redux Reducer Bundles](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux)
You have a “module” file which represents a single reducer along with any action creators or constants that are associated with it.
Tyler quite enjoys this pattern and I used it in this fist version of this course.
It breaks down a little when you start to have action types that aren’t associate with a single reducer.

[Domain based Folders](https://marmelab.com/blog/2015/12/17/react-directory-structure.html): You group actions, reducers etc by the domain they care about, rather than separating them out into generic “actions”, “reducers”, folders
