# Immutable JS

- [Immutable JS Website](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/)

### Definition

- **Immutable** data cannot be changed once created.
- Immutable collection for Javascript.

### Benefits

- Leads to simpler application development.
- No defensive copying.
- Enables advanced memoization.
- Enables change detection techniques with simple logic.

### Efficiency

- These data structures are highly efficient on modern Javascript VMs by using structural sharing via [[hash-maps-tries]] and [[vector tries]], minimizing the need to copy or cache data.
