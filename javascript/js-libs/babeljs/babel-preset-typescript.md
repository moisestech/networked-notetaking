# Preset Typescript

- This preset is recommended if you use TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript. It includes the following plugins:
- (`@babel/preset-typescript`)[https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript#installation]

- This plugin adds support for the syntax used by the TypeScript programming language. However, this plugin does not add the ability to type-check the JavaScript passed to it. For that, you will need to install and set up TypeScript.
- (`@babel/plugin-transform-typescript`)[https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript]
